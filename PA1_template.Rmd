y <- data$date 
aves <- aggregate(x ~ y, data= data,sum)
hist(aves$x,main ='Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day',xlab ='total number of steps ')
# mean and median of total number of steps taken per day
summary(aves)
mean(aves$x,na.rm = TRUE)
median(aves$x,na.rm = TRUE)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
